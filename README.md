From FreeCodeCamp's Certified Full Stack Developer Course. 

I chose not to make a public repository about all my "vanilla" JavaScript activities, 
because I really don't know how to select an ideal/a recommended license here; 
and I shared a few JavaScript activities on my personal Codepen profile. 
But, for Python, I chose to make a public repository.
